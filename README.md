Vimeo Player API Playground
===========================

Modified from [Vimeo's official example](https://github.com/vimeo/player-api).

Included is the Vimeo JavaScript library for using their API with their Universal Embed code.
They suggest that you either host the JS file yourself, or link to our official hosted copy:

For more information on the JS API, see [Vimeo's player documentation page](https://developer.vimeo.com/player/js-api).
