Vimeo Player API Playground
===========================

Modified from [Vimeo's official example](https://github.com/vimeo/player-api).  I have added extensive comments in my attempt to understand what is going on.

Included is the Vimeo JavaScript library for using their API with their Universal Embed code.
They suggest that you either host the JS file yourself, or link to their official hosted copy:

For more information on the Vimeo's Player JS API, see [the official documentation page](https://developer.vimeo.com/player/js-api).
